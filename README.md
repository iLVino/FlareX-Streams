# FlareX Feeds

FlareX Feeds is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Flare Network, designed to consume and utilize price feeds from the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSOv2) in a cross-chain environment. By integrating LayerZero, our project enables seamless and secure communication of these price feeds across different blockchain networks, unlocking new possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

## Features

- **Decentralized Price Feeds**: Utilizes FTSOv2 to fetch real-time price feeds for various assets such as FLR/USD, BTC/USD, and ETH/USD.
- **Cross-Chain Integration with LayerZero**: Enables the transmission of price feed data to other chains, facilitating cross-chain DeFi applications.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple front-end interface built with React and ethers.js, allowing users to connect their wallets, fetch price feed data, and send messages across chains.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Ensures secure communication of data through LayerZeroâ€™s endpoint and receiver interfaces.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- MetaMask (or any other Ethereum wallet)
- Foundry

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlareX-Feeds.git
cd FlareX-Feeds
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Install Foundry Dependencies

```bash
forge install
```

## Usage

### Connecting Wallet

- Open the application in your browser.
- Click on the "Connect Wallet" button.
- Follow the instructions to connect your MetaMask wallet.

### Fetching Feed Values

- Click on the "Fetch Feed Values" button to get the latest price feeds from FTSOv2.

### Cross-Chain Swap

- Select the asset pair from the dropdown menu.
- Enter the amount to swap.
- Enter the payload (e.g., destination address).
- Select the destination chain ID.
- Click on "Send LayerZero Message" to initiate the cross-chain swap.

## Smart Contract

The `FtsoV2FeedConsumer` smart contract interacts with FTSOv2 to fetch price feed data and uses LayerZero for cross-chain messaging.

### Contract Source

`src/FtsoV2FeedConsumer.sol`

### Key Functions

- `getFtsoV2CurrentFeedValues()`: Fetches the current price feed values from FTSOv2.
- `lzReceive()`: Handles incoming messages from LayerZero.
- `sendMessage()`: Sends a cross-chain message using LayerZero.
- `estimateFees()`: Estimates the fees for sending a cross-chain message.

## Front-End Application

The front-end application is built using React and ethers.js, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the smart contract.

### Key Components

- **AppBar and Toolbar**: Navigation bar with title and wallet connection status.
- **Feed Values**: Displays the latest price feeds.
- **Cross-Chain Swap**: Interface for initiating cross-chain swaps.

### Key Files

- `src/FlareFeedConsumer.js`: Main component for the front-end application.
- `src/ABI/FtsoV2FeedConsumer.json`: ABI for the smart contract.

## Deployment

### Deploying the Smart Contract

1. **Compile and Deploy the Contract**:

```bash
forge build
source .env
forge script script/DeployFtsoV2FeedConsumer.s.sol --rpc-url https://coston-api.flare.network/ext/C/rpc --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

2. **Update the Front-End**:
   - Ensure your front end is connected to the deployed smart contract and update the contract address if necessary.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Application**:

```bash
npm start
```

2. **Open in Browser**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
